# Murid Abu Hamed - Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal **developer portfolio website**, created to highlight my work, skills, and professional journey.  
I am **Murid Abu Hamed**, a Software Engineer with experience in **web development, backend systems, and AI/ML projects**.  

The website is fully **responsive** and includes:
- Interactive project and testimonial sliders
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Scroll-based animations
- A working contact form

It serves as a central place where recruiters, collaborators, and visitors can learn more about me and my work.

## 📂 Project Structure

This portfolio website is organized into the following core files and folders:

- `index.html` – The main HTML page of the site
- `styles/` – Contains all CSS files for layout, themes, and responsive design
- `scripts/` – Includes JavaScript files for interactivity, animations, sliders, and form handling
- `assets/` – Stores images, icons, and other media used in the website

The project is lightweight and easy to maintain, with clear separation between structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and functionality (JavaScript).
