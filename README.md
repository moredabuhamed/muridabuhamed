# Murid Abu Hamed - Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal **developer portfolio website**, created to highlight my work, skills, and professional journey.  
I am **Murid Abu Hamed**, a Software Engineer with experience in **web development, backend systems, and AI/ML projects**.  

The website is fully **responsive** and includes:
- Interactive project and testimonial sliders
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Scroll-based animations
- A working contact form

It serves as a central place where recruiters, collaborators, and visitors can learn more about me and my work.

*(This site is hosted on GitHub Pages. I am continuously improving its design and features to make it more professional and visually appealing.)*

## 📂 Project Structure

This portfolio website is organized as follows:

- `index.html` – The main HTML file that builds the structure of the site
- `assets/` – Contains all supporting files and resources:
  - `css/` – All CSS files for layout, design, and responsive behavior
  - `js/` – JavaScript files for interactivity, animations, sliders, and form handling
  - `img/` – Icons, profile photos, and other media assets (if any)
  
## ✨ Features

This portfolio website was built to represent my professional profile and includes:

- **Responsive Design**  
  I designed the layout to adapt smoothly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**  
  I implemented a theme switcher that remembers the user's preference using localStorage.

- **Scroll Animations**  
  I used ScrollReveal.js to animate sections as they come into view, adding a dynamic user experience.

- **Project & Testimonial Sliders**  
  I integrated Swiper.js to display my projects and testimonials in clean, swipeable carousels.

- **Contact Form Integration**  
  I connected the contact form to EmailJS so visitors can reach me directly without needing a backend.

- **Sticky Navigation & Scroll-Up Button**  
  For smoother navigation, I added a fixed header and scroll-to-top button that appear on scroll.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

I built this project using the following technologies:

- **HTML5** – For the structure and semantic layout of the site  
- **CSS3** – For styling, layout, responsiveness, and theming  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – For interactivity, dynamic effects, and logic  
- **Swiper.js** – To create responsive sliders for projects and testimonials  
- **ScrollReveal.js** – To animate sections as users scroll through the page  
- **EmailJS** – To handle contact form submissions without needing a backend

All components were built with performance, clarity, and scalability in mind.
